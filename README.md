# Key-Word Spotting Model

This is the homework for the course [Deep Learning for Audio](https://github.com/markovka17/dla) at the [CS Faculty](https://cs.hse.ru/en/)
  of [HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/).
  
## Results Representation

To represent the results download `kws_results_representation.ipynb` and run all the cells one by one (preferably google colab).
